   <h1> My web page project</h1>
   
<section>
   <h2> Project name and url of the Site's Homepage</h2>
   <p>The name for the website That I chose for the website project is <b>"The King Of Sweets."</b> My URL will reflect the store's name, and the beginning of the address will depend on the site or hosting service I use. Ideally, I would like the domain to be <b>kingofsweets.com</b>, but if that’s not available, I may use a platform like Google Sites. In that case, the URL might look like <b>https://sites.google.com/view/thekingofsweets.</b>
<i> (this is just an example and will be updated after the end of the project)</i>. Ultimately, the final URL will depend on the hosting provider I choose.

        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
   <p>My website project will be a static informational website for a distribution center for Arab sweets, which are great and I enjoy those a lot, especially the viral Dubai chocolate and its varieties. The website will be for a distribution center that distributes to stores, restaurants, events, catering, and other uses. It will display the menu with photos, descriptions, and prices, but there will not be an option for online ordering. However, the contact information, both email and phone number, will be provided so that they can contact us to place an order. The customers will call the center and the staff will help them choose the best option depending on their order and need, whether a small, big, or personal order.</p>

   <p>The website will act like a digital brochure where visitors can learn about the brand, check out the menu, find locations to buy the products, and access contact information. The business will also support catering services for events and special occasions.</p>

   <p>The main objectives and goals of my website are to give potential customers the opportunity to browse through our catalog of items and see what they want, like a brochure for the business. It will also be for other businesses to understand the items available and the things the center offers. It will help build brand identity, show the items available, their quality ingredients, and provide contact information. Customers can call and ask about the best course of action for their order. Even custom or large orders will be provided. Since there will not be any online ordering, the focus will be on showing the products in a clear and appealing way, with good visuals, easy navigation, and helpful information for the customer.</p>

   <P>The target audience for the site will include, but is not limited to, restaurant owners, store owners, buyers, personal buyers, catering services, businesses, and individuals who are interested in high-quality Arab sweets of all kinds from around the world. This also includes people hosting parties and events. Catering will be limited to local use, while personal and business buyers will be targeted nationally after a successful start in the USA. This decision is based on the current real-world demand for cultural desserts and the growing popularity of Arabic sweets in international markets, especially in areas with diverse culinary interests and the rising craze for the famous Dubai chocolate. </P>

   <h2>Website Content</h2>
   <p>The website will consist of five main pages:</p>
    <ul>
       <li><b>Home: </b>Introduction to the brand with beautiful images of the products and the purpose of the site.</li>
       <li><b> Menu:</b>A list of sweets offered with names, descriptions, and prices.</li>

       <li><b> About us:</b> The story and values of the business and its commitment to quality as well as important info that concerns the customer.</li>

       <li><b> Contact:</b>Location, phone number, and email address for inquiries and calls.</li>

       <li><b> Where to Buy & Catering:</b>A list of shops and restaurants carrying the sweets, and details about the catering services offered. Expected shipping times, and important shipping, catering, and business, info for other businessess.</li>
   </ul>
    <p>This content will give visitors all the information they need without overwhelming them. It helps showcase the brand and attract new clients while keeping the experience simple and accessible as well as informational.
    </p>

   <p> As for the design ideas and concepts, the website will have an aesthetically pleasing, fun, and modern look. I will use warm and elegant colors such as gold, cream, dark brown, and burgundy to reflect the richness of Arabic culture. The product images will be high-quality, professional, and high-resolution to highlight the textures and details of each item, making them visually appealing to customers. The font choices will be clean and modern, with elegant heading styles to give the website a premium and polished feel.</p>

    <p> Web design principles such as visual hierarchy, balance, and contrast will guide the overall layout. Proper use of spacing and alignment will help keep the content organized and easy to read. The site will also follow responsive design practices so it looks and functions well on both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a smooth user experience for all visitors.</p>

   <h2>Website Structure, Standards, and Milestones
   </h2>
   <p>
    HTML will be used to create the structure of the website, allowing me to organize content using semantic tags like section, article, nav, paragraph. CSS will be used to control the presentation—styling fonts, colors, spacing, and layout. Using both together separates structure from design, which makes the site easier to manage and update.
   </p>
   <p>Writing semantic HTML and following web standards helps improve accessibility for screen readers, improves SEO (search engine optimization), and ensures that the website is compatible across all modern browsers. It also helps other developers (or future me) understand the code more easily and make updates or changes faster.

</p>
<p>Timeline of project milestones: <br>In Week 1, I will focus on finalizing the project idea and creating the basic HTML structure of the website. During Week 2, I will apply CSS styling and begin building the homepage. In Week 3, I plan to create and style the menu and about pages. Week 4 will be dedicated to adding the contact page as well as the catering and location information pages. Finally, in Week 5, I will complete final edits, perform an accessibility check, validate the code, and upload the finished website.</p>
